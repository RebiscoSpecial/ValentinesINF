     Happy Valentines, BabeðŸ’•
My Dearest Hanna, I'm sitting here with a flood of emotions, thinking about the 362 days since I created that little website just for you. 
It's crazy how time flies, but my love for you only gets stronger. Remember 406 days ago when I spilled my heart out and confessed my feelings? Yeah, 
those were the nerve-wracking but beautiful beginnings. I need you to know, babe, that the website wasn't some attempt to show off or put a price tag on our love. 
It was my way of shouting to the world that what we have is priceless and totally unique. Sure, the digital thing might not last forever, but my love for you? It's the kind that stands the test of time.
So, here's to us this Valentine's Day, celebrating the real, messy, and incredible love we've built. That website is just a reminder of our journey, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Happy Valentine's Day, my love.Â 
 I Love you - YourAttitudeBoyfriend.ðŸ˜˜
