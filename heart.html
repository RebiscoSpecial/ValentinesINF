     Happy Valentines, LoveðŸ’•

I have something to tell you for this very special day so please red its short ;3. Since the day I got to know you,
      there's something about you that makes my heart skip a beat. 
      Your thoughts linger in my mind, and everything about you is endlessly interesting to me.

      I realize you're the one who makes everything feel different.
      You're not just special; you're the love of my life.
